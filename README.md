# Research on viral vulnerability of the regions in Sydney
This assignment present an investigation of the viral vulnerability of 312 different neighbourhoods area in Sydney and share data processing and analyses skills like scraping, spatial join using geoPandas, indexing and correlation analysis using matplotlib. Key findings include a viral vulnerability analysis of all area using population_density, percertage_of_the_aged, health_service_density, hospital_bed_availability and commuters_scale. In addition, a correlation analysis of vulnerability against number of covid-19 cases and tests done is done.
